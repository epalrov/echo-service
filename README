echo:           example of multi-process TCP based Echo Service (RFC862).

                One echo service is defined as a connection based application
                on TCP. A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 7.
                Once a connection is established any data received is sent
                back. This continues until the calling user terminates the
                connection.
                The TCP echo server accepts a connection and then loops
                continuously, reading all transmitted data and sending it back
                to the client on the same socket.
                The server continues reading until it detects end-of-file, at
                which point it closes its socket (so that the client sees
                end-of-file if it is still reading from its socket).
                Since the client may send an indefinite amount of data to the
                server (and thus servicing the client may take an indefinite
                amount of time), a concurrent server design is appropriate,
                so that multiple clients can be simultaneously served.
